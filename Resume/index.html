                            Following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, making it easier for employees to win pay discrimination claims, became law. Ginsburg was credited with helping to inspire the law.

                            Ginsburg is believed to be the first Supreme Court justice to officiate at a same-sex wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist.

                            Her time on the court earned her a reputation as a "cautious jurist" and a moderate.[44] David S. Tatel replaced her after Ginsburg's appointment to the Supreme Court.
